    <h1 class="text-center">Welcome to Pen & Pixel 2016</h1>
    	<div class="container">
        	<p id="welcome_message">Pen and Pixel is an annual creative multimedia exhibition held by the students of Limerick Institute of Technology in Clonmel. This year the event will be held on Wednesday the 25th of May at 6.00pm in the Clonmel campus of Limerick School of Art and Design. The annual event has slowly transformed into a spectacular end of year exhibition. As part of the exhibition, we are showcasing the work of students from the past year. This exhibition will feature both digital and analogue pieces from the students of LSAD Clonmel. 
	<br>
The exhibition allows students to showcase their creative talents to the public. In the past, the event has been known as Digital Expressions and since 2011 the name has been changed to Pen & Pixel. It was felt that this new name better reflected the creative process of designing and then creating a piece of work. This year there has been a particular emphasis placed on showcasing both digital and analogue work, spanning the entire range of the multimedia sector.
	<br>
Students can submit work by handing it to a Pen & Pixel member.
	<br>
Meet the Pen & Pixel Co-ordination Team The exhibition is being organised by second year students, in combination with their Effective Teamwork Module. The team consists of: Claire Murray, Declan Hanley, Eimear Hough, Emily Kearns, Gareth Saunders and Sarah Long. In relation to an online presence Pen & Pixel have a large presence including accounts on social media sites like Facebook & Twitter. Pen & Pixel can be found on Facebook by searching for Pen and Pixel Clonmel or simply using the following link, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Limerick-School-of-Art-and-Design/105709352794967?fref=ts" target="_blank">Facebook.</a>
	<br>
Pen & Pixel can also be found and followed on Twitter by using the following link <a href="https://twitter.com/LSADatLIT?lang=en" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Pen & Pixel also has its own website which promotes the exhibition. Having a large online presence allows not only faculties and students but also gives the public access to the latest news and updates about the exhibition. This also may attract potential students. 
	<br>
This year, there is great excitement as it is the first year that Erasmus students and students on the “Science without borders” programme are involved in our exhibition. The students in question are from, Brazil, The Netherlands, Spain and Italy. This will greatly aid in promoting the exhibition worldwide, and will aid in raising awareness of LIT-LSAD and the Clonmel Campus’ relationship with colleges in these countries.</p>
